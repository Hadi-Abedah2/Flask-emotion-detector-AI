# emotion_detector_webapp 
I made use of the embedded Watson AI libraries(NLP library that includes functions for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, text classification, language detection, etc.), to create and deploy an application that would perform emotion detection on a provided text.  

these libraries have been pre-installed on Skills Network Labs Cloud IDE where I developed the project.
These libraries may also be accessed through your personal systems. The guidelines for the same are available on the Watson AI library page.
